    "Conventional ammo and mag managing is so last year, isn't it?
    Well buckle up, because here's a handgun that fires a bullet-like projectile WITHOUT
    forcing you to manage a bunch of magazines!
    This puppy creates it's own bullets the moment you hold the trigger, by concentrating and
    hardening pure light. Sadly, we had to sacrifice some rate of fire, as creating the projectile takes
    a bit of time and generates quite a bit of heat.
    Gloves are recommended when operating this gun, as the excess heat it releases might leave a nasty burn. 
    Warning: ALWAYS keep the exhaust vents at the back clear and do not touch anything other than the grip or battery after use!"
